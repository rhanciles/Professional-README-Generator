# Professional README Generator

## Description

How cool is it to have a README file self-generated for you after inputting the contents. This little app is designed to do just that, albeit through a command line. Just answer a few questions and off you go; saving you some precious time from configuring and formatting the document. I’m sure every developer would welcome such a handy tool.

## Installation

The app is quite simple and straightforward to use. However, it does require you to have a CLI based program installed like Visual Studio and bit of coding knowledge which is expected if you need an app like this. It will also need the “package.jason” which you can get by running the Node.js “npm init” command. You then need a dependency call “inquirer” installed which is also straight forward. Just enter “npm install inquirer” into the command line. Once that’s done, you are good to go. 

## Usage

To use the program, enter “node index.js” to run the program and follow the prompts. You will find you newly generated “README” file in the “starter” folder upon completion.

Here is a demo of how the program works, or you can click on this link to watch the video.
