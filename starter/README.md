## Installation

The app is quite simple and straightforward to use. However, it does require you to have a CLI based program installed like Visual Studio and bit of coding knowledge which is expected if you need an app like this.

## Usage

To use the program, enter “node index.js” to run the program and follow the prompts. You will find you newly generated “README” file in the “starter” folder upon completion.

## License

MIT

## Contributing

This app was designed by me. However i must acknowledge the help and support I received from my friends at Ed-X.

## Test

Using it, is the best way to test this app.
