# Professional README Generator
_A professional App, dynamically generating high-quality README files, using CLI_

## Overview
Looking back at the time when I was a complete novice to any form of coding whatsoever. I remember how daunting it was to grapple with Git Bash, GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc. What’s more, even though that’s not in the code, you are subconsciously expected to know things like commit, pull request, call a function, write a readme file, etc. Like a baby who instantly knows how to cry, breast feed, laugh, etc. If only coding was like that. 
So, I thought to myself. What if an app is created to take care of some of these expectations.  How cool it would be for example, to have a README file self-generated for you after inputting the contents and that’s what this repo is about.

## Description
This little app is designed to create a “README” file for the user, albeit through a command line. All that’s required of you is just answer a few questions and off you go, saving you some precious time from configuring and formatting the document. I’m sure every developer would welcome such a handy tool.

## Installation
The app is quite simple and straightforward to use. However, it does require you to have a CLI based program installed like Visual Studio and bit of coding knowledge which is expected if you need an app like this. It will also need the “package.jason” which you can get by running the Node.js “npm init” command. You then need a dependency call “inquirer” installed which is also straight forward. Just enter “npm install inquirer” into the command line. Once that’s done, you are good to go. 
Usage
To use the program, enter “node index.js” to run the program and follow the prompts. You will find you newly generated “README” file in the “starter” folder upon completion.
Here is a demo of how the program works, or you can click [**here.**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X3vH5NUXRlVUGNnWPDYdiZWile1bTG5Z/view?usp=sharing) to watch the video.
